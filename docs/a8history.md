## Activ8or History: an Aside

Activ8or was born of years of AppDelegates' development for the front and back-ends of Event Marketing installations. We've implemented
systems in a variety of languages and on a variety of platforms. Common requirements came up in many, if not all, of these jobs: guest registration, 
stats, experience completion (electronic and/or physical takeaway), leaderboards and more. We've done jobs where the back-end was in the 
activation itself (especially with notoriously bad venue internet), where the back-end was in the cloud, or a mix of both (relay mode). Activ8or 
implements everything we've learned over 10 years in interactive event development. We hope you like it and we hop you contribute to it!
