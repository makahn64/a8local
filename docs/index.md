Activ8or is a series of open-source apps and tools designed to simplify the implementation of interactive event marketing installations. Activ8or provides:
- Guest registration.
- Queueing and queue place notification via SMS and Email.
- Experience (activation) logging and email/SMS outreach on completion.
- Experience real-time data sharing (think head-to-head racing game) using websockets or polling.
- Media storage and retrieval for experiences, guest avatars and more.
- Source platform agnostic print queueing.
- Collection of statistics, demographic info, etc. for a given activation.
- Suite of example applications such as tablet-based registration, scoreboards, digital signage and more.

Activ8or is open source and fully documented. You can use it as is or add to it as you wish. Deployment is easy on any NodeJS-capable supported platform:

- Mac and Linux OS systems including systems as inexpensive as Raspberry Pi and Wandboard.
- PCs running Windows should work, but this is not fully tested (give it a shot).
- Google Cloud Marketplace single click implementation (4Q2019).
- A Dockerized implementation is available for testing and/or deployment.

## Activ8or History, an Aside

Activ8or was born of years of AppDelegates' development for the front and back-ends of Event Marketing installations. We've implemented
systems in a variety of languages and on a variety of platforms. Common requirements came up in many, if not all, of these jobs: guest registration, 
stats, experience completion (electronic and/or physical takeaway), leaderboards and more. We've done jobs where the back-end was in the 
activation itself (especially with notoriously bad venue internet), where the back-end was in the cloud, or a mix of both (relay mode). Activ8or 
implements everything we've learned over 10 years in interactive event development. We hope you like it and we hop you contribute to it!
