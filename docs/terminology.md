## Terminology 

The Activ8or architecture involves several entities stored in its database as explained here. All entities include expansion fields ("metadata") to add whatever
information the developer wants to include that we didn't think of.

### Guest

A Guest is exactly that, someone visiting the activation. The guest entity includes fields for name, contact info, email and more. Guests are typically registered
before entering the activation, though this is not a requirement. When a Guest is registered, they are assigned a univerally unique ID (UUID) which is then used
to refer to them throughout the API. This same code could be used in a RFID card or in a barcode for activations that make us of such things.

### Experience

An Experience is a record of one or more guests going through an activation. For example, if jenny@test.com and bob@test.com go through "Sam's Super VR Dunk Tank", then an
Experience entity is created that includes a link to the Experience Configuration (see below), the Guests involved, the date/time, and media generated (e.g. a photo takeaway),
possibly a score, whether the Experience is complete or in process (for multi-stage experiences), etc. Periodically, Activ8or checks for new completed Experiences and
will send an electronic takeaway ("Hey Jenny, hope you had fun in the dunktank!"). Electronic completion is completely optional and configurable.

Experiences that are games will often have scores associated with them. These scores can be read through the API and presented in a digital signage leaderboard. Check out
our Leaderboard Demo for an example.

### Experience Configuration

Each Experience in your activation has a configuration. This includes the name ("Sam's Super VR Dunk Tank"), queueing settings (e.g. how long a queue, whether to notify
Guests when their spot is available) and completion settings (e.g. send email, send sms, do nothing).

### Queue Entry

A Queue Entry includes a pointer to a Guest and an Experience Configuration. Activ8or regularly monitors the length of the queue and can be configured
to send out notification, usually text messages, to let Guests know when they're "up". The Queue Entries can be read via the API to create 
digital signage waiting lists.

### Media

Activ8or supports the uploading of any binary files as Media. Typically this is used for activation photos or videos, but it can be used for Guest avatars and even 
release signatures.

### Data Object

Data Objects are a generic Key/Value store that can be useful to networked experience developers. Data Objects can be subscribed to
via SocketIO (as can other data types) for realtime data sharing between Experiences (think racing data in a VR racing game on multiple
systems).

### Settings

Also a Key/Value store, but Settings are used for Activ8or configuration. This can include information like API keys for
email services, email templates, and more.

### Users

If security is turned on, then Users are entities with login rights to Activ8or. Check out the section on security for more
info.

### Events

Events include a date range, venue and name of the event. For example: "Widgetco's Monster Truck Experience" at "Sun Devil Stadium" on
June 4, 2023. The Event information can be used to customize any messages sent to Guests. More on this in the section on 
Completions, below.
